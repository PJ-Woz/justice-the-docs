# Markdown - Introduction
In this simple introduction, you'll learn the basics of Markdown formatting. It takes about two hours to master those basics.


Grab something to drink and a few snacks, for you're about to enter on a Markdown Journey!
# Line Break  
Here you'll learn how to create paragraphs with line break.

## What Is Line Break?
When you read a text, paragraphs are those useful chunks of text that ease reading.  
Every paragraph should consists of thoughts about one topic. Here, we talk about creating paragraphs in Markdown. 
### How to Insert Line Breaks
There are several ways of creating paragraphs with line breaks in Markdown.

#### HTML Tag
To create a line break at the end of your line, use \<p>.

If you've ever used HTML, you'll surely remember the "\<p>" tag. In this tag, "p" stands for "paragraph".

<p>It looks like this:</p>

<code>\<p>It looks like this:\<p></code>

#### Double ENTER
To create a line break at the end of your line, you can use the ENTER key on your keaboard. Just press the ENTER key twice.

You create another paragraph this way with an empty line in between different paragraphs you want to create.

#### Double Space And ENTER
To create a line break at the end of your line, you can use the space bar twice at the end of your line and then press the ENTER key.  
It's easy, right? This method is also easy, as Markdown is known for its simplicity.  
You've got to trust me that I've just done that. Actually, you can see that in the Preview. The paragraph spacing created with double space and ENTER is smaller than the paragraph spacing created with double ENTER or with "\<p>".
<!-- Example of another paragraph -->
## Summary
Congratulations! You can now enter line breaks in no time!
<!-- Example of bold -->
# Bold
Here you'll learn how to create text in **bold**.  

## What Is Bold?
When you read a text, **bold** is typeface whose lines are **thicker**. It's used to emphasise one **word** or **a whole phrase**.
### How to Insert Text in Bold
As in [Line Breaks](#how-to-insert-line-breaks), there are various ways of doing this.
#### Asterisks
**To create your text in bold**, use double asterisk, "\*\*".

It looks like this:

<code>\*\*To create your text in bold\*\*, use double asterisk, "\*\*".</code>

Remember to close the text in bold with double asterisks, or you'll end up like **this*. How did that happen? You'll learn [below](#italics).
<!-- Add link -->
<!-- Added -->
#### Underscore signs
__To create your text in bold__, use double underscore sign, "\_\_".

It looks like this:

<code>\_\_To create your text in bold__, use double underscore sign, "\_\_".</code>

Remember to close the text in bold with double underscore sign, or you'll end up like __this_. How did that happen? You'll learn [below](#italics).
<!-- Add link -->
<!-- Added -->
## Summary
Congratulations! You can now create text in **bold** in no time!
<!-- Example of italic  -->
# Italics
Here you'll learn how to create text in *italics*.
## What Is Italics?
When you read a text, *italics* is typeface whose lines are *slanted to the right*. It's used to write titles of books, for instance [*The Lord of the Rings*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings).
### How to Insert Text in Italics
As in [Line Breaks](#how-to-insert-line-breaks) and [Bold](#how-to-insert-text-in-bold), there are various ways of doing this. This is in fact very similar to creating text in bold.
#### Asterisks
*To create your text in italics*, use a single asterisk, "\*".

It looks like this:

<code>\*To create your text in italics\*, use a single asterisk, "\*"</code>

Do you remember the note about closing the text in the [section on Bold](#asterisks) with double asterisks or else you end up like **this*? It happened because the text was interpreted as a text with an asterisk in front of it and highlighted with italics.
<!-- Add link -->
<!-- Added -->
#### Underscore signs
_To create your text in italics_, use a single underscore sign, "\_".

It looks like this:

<code>\_To create your text in italics_, use a single underscore sign, "\_".</code>

Do you remember the note about closing the text in the [section on Bold](#underscore-signs) with double underscore signs or else you end up like __this_? It happened because the text was interpreted as a text with an underscore sign in front of it and highlighted with italics.
<!-- Add link -->
<!-- Added -->
## Summary
Congratulations! You can now create text in *italics* in no time!

<!-- Example of headers -->
# Headers
Here you'll learn about Headers.
## What Are Headers?
Headers are titles to sections of your text. In fact, you've been seeing headers here all the time! 

In the previous sections on [Line Break](#line-break), [Bold](#bold) and [Italics](#italics), there are four different types of headers. In this section, there are also four types of headers. The first one opens the whole section on [Headers](#headers). The second one opened this section about [what headers are](#what-are-headers). And the third one is just below on [How to Insert Headers](#how-to-insert-headers).
### How to Insert Headers
As in [Line Breaks](#how-to-insert-line-breaks), [Bold](#how-to-insert-text-in-bold) and [Italics](#how-to-insert-text-in-italics), there are various ways of doing this. To be precise, there are three ways of inserting Headers. However, they play different roles.
#### Equation Symbol
To create a header, use the equation symbol, "=", three times and press the ENTER key. However, it creates only the largest type of header. It's best used with major sections, like the title of this help text, [*A Very Simple Introduction to Markdown*](#a-very-simple-introduction-to-markdown).
<!--- No i tutaj jest problem, bo "omit in toc" uniemożliwia przeniesienie :( --->

It looks like this:
```
A Very Simple Introduction to Markdown
===
```
<!-- Sample
---
-->
#### Minus Symbol
To create a header, use the minus symbol, "-", three times and press the ENTER key. However, it creates only the second-largest type of header. It's best used with major sub-sections, like the title of the second sub-section here, [What Are Headers](#what-are-headers).

It looks like this:
```
What Are Headers?
---
```
#### Hash Symbol
To create a header, use the hash symbol, "#". However, unlike the [Equation Symbol](#equation-symbol) or [Minus Symbol](#minus-symbol), it can be used to create all types of headers. Actually, it can even create the largest header, just like the equation symbol, or the second-largest header, just like the minus symbol.

It looks like this:
```
# A Very Simple Introduction to Markdown
```
To create headers for sub-sections and sub-sub-sections, just add more hash symbols. For instance, this sub-section uses four hash symbols. 

Its header looks like this:
```
#### Hash Symbol
```
You can use as many as six hash symbols to create sections and sub-sections in your text.
## Summary
Congratulations! You can now create headers in no time!
<!-- Example of external link -->
# Links
Here you'll learn how to create links.
## What Are Links?
Links are like doors that can bring you to a website on the Internet, to another file or to a section in a document.

The links that lead you to a website on the Internet or to another file are called external links.

The links that lead you to a section in a document are called internal links. In fact, you've already seen many internal links in this text!

### How to Insert Links
If you want to create a link to something, use square brackets, "[" and "]", to give your link a name inside the square brackets. It doesn't have to be the name of the thing you want to link to, just type anything you want.

Then, right after the square brackets, use round brackets, "(", ")", to paste the address of the thing you want to link.
#### Websites
If you want to create a link to a website, use square brackets, "[" and "]", to give your link a name inside the square brackets. It doesn't have to be the name of the website you want to link to, just type anything you want.

Then, right after the square brackets, use round brackets, "(", ")", to paste the address of the website you want to link.

For example, this is [a link to the website of my company, Translatorion](https://translatorion.com/language/en/translatorion/). 

It looks like this:


<code>For example, this is \[a link to the website of my company, Translatorion]\(https://translatorion.com/language/en/translatorion/).</code>
<!-- Example of link to another file -->

#### Other Files
If you want to create a link to another file, use square brackets, "[" and "]", to give your link a name inside the square brackets. It doesn't have to be the name of the file you want to link to, just type anything you want.

Then, right after the square brackets, use round brackets, "(", ")", to paste the address of the file you want to link.

In Visual Studio Code, which is the program that's used to create this manual, you will see a list of possible files to link to in the round brackets that are in the same folder as the file you create your current text.

This is a link to [the alpha version of this manual](Praca-2022-11-20.md) that was created during classes. 

It looks like this:

<code>This is a link to \[the alpha version of this manual](Praca-2022-11-20.md) that was created during classes.</code>

#### Other Sections
If you want to create a link to another section – marked by a header – in a document, use square brackets, "[" and "]", to give your link a name inside the square brackets. It doesn't have to be the name of the header you want to link to, just type anything you want.

Then, right after the square brackets, use round brackets, "(", ")", to paste the address of the header you want to link.

In Visual Studio Code, which is the program that's used to create this manual, you will see a list of possible headers in the text to link to in the round brackets.

This is [a link to the Links section](#links) in this document.

It looks like this:

<code>This is \[a link to the Links section](#links) in this document.</code>

## Summary
Congratulations! You can now create links in no time!

<!-- Example of an image -->
# Images
Here you'll learn how to add images.

## What Are Images?
Images are graphical representations of objects. You can add images to your texts to show something. After all,
> A picture is worth a thousand words

### How to Insert Images
Inserting an image is similar to creating [Links](#links). In fact, an image is a link to a file with an image.

#### Basic Link to an Image in a Repository
If you want to create a link to an image – but without displaying the image – in a document, use square brackets, "[" and "]", to give your link a name inside the square brackets. It doesn't have to be the name of the file you want to link to, just type anything you want.

Then, right after the square brackets, use round brackets, "(", ")", to paste the name of the image file you want to link.

In Visual Studio Code, which is the program that's used to create this manual, you will see a list of possible image files that are in your repository to link to in the round brackets.

This is [a link to an image of a shark](./Images/IMG_20200401_210429.jpg).

It looks like this:

<code>This is \[a link to an image of a shark](./Images/IMG_20200401_210429.jpg).</code>

#### Displayed Image
If you want to create a link to an image – and display the image – in a document, use square brackets, "[" and "]", to give your link a name inside the square brackets. It doesn't have to be the name of the file you want to link to, just type anything you want.

Then, right after the square brackets, use round brackets, "(", ")", to paste the name of the image file you want to link.

In Visual Studio Code, which is the program that's used to create this manual, you will see a list of possible image files that are in your repository to link to in the round brackets.

This is a displayed image of a shark:

It looks like this:

<code>\!\[a link to an image of a shark](./Images/IMG_20200401_210429.jpg)</code>

#### Link to an Image on the Internet
If you want to create a link to an image that's on the internet – but without displaying the image – in a document, use square brackets, "[" and "]", to give your link a name inside the square brackets. It doesn't have to be the name of the file you want to link to, just type anything you want.

Then, right after the square brackets, use round brackets, "(", ")", to paste the link to the image file you want to link.

This is [a link to an image on the internet](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Cieszyn_Rynek2.jpg/1280px-Cieszyn_Rynek2.jpg).  

It looks like this:

<code>This is \[a link to an image on the internet](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Cieszyn_Rynek2.jpg/1280px-Cieszyn_Rynek2.jpg).</code>

#### Link to a Displayed Image from the Internet
If you want to create a link to an image that's on the internet – and display the image – in a document, use square brackets, "[" and "]", to give your link a name inside the square brackets. It doesn't have to be the name of the file you want to link to, just type anything you want.

Then, right after the square brackets, use round brackets, "(", ")", to paste the link to the image file you want to link.

This is a displayed image from the internet.
![a link to an image on the internet](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Cieszyn_Rynek2.jpg/1280px-Cieszyn_Rynek2.jpg)

<!-- Example of an image with hover text -->
<!-- Remember to add a screenshot with this hover text - doesn't work -->
#### Image with a Hover Text
If you want to create a link to an image – and display the image with a hover text – in a document, use square brackets, "[" and "]", to give your link a name inside the square brackets. It doesn't have to be the name of the file you want to link to, just type anything you want.

Then, right after the square brackets, use round brackets, "(", ")", to paste the link to the image file you want to link.

To add a hover text to your image, type the text you want to appear in quotation marks {""} right after the link. When the mouse cursor hovers over the image, the text you've typed will appear.

In Visual Studio Code, which is the program that's used to create this manual, you will see a list of possible image files that are in your repository to link to in the round brackets.

This is a displayed image of a shark:
![a link to an image of a shark](./Images/IMG_20200401_210429.jpg "Technical Writer Shark")

It looks like this:

<code>\!\[a link to an image of a shark](./Images/IMG_20200401_210429.jpg "Technical Writer Shark")</code>

#### Link to a Gif
If you like gifs – animated images – you can also link them! They will move in the preview. You can also add a hover text to them.

If you want to create a link to a gif – and display the gif – in a document, use square brackets, "[" and "]", to give your link a name inside the square brackets. It doesn't have to be the name of the file you want to link to, just type anything you want.

Then, right after the square brackets, use round brackets, "(", ")", to paste the name of the gif file you want to link.

In Visual Studio Code, which is the program that's used to create this manual, you will see a list of possible gif files that are in your repository to link to in the round brackets.

This is a displayed gif file:

![displayed gif](./Images/cat-computer.gif "Is This What Technical Writing Is Like?")

It looks like this:

<code>\!\[displayed gif](./Images/cat-computer.gif "Is This What Technical Writing Is Like?")</code>

## Summary
Congratulations! You can now add images in no time!

<!-- Example of quote -->

# Quoting
Here you'll learn how to quote.

## What Is Quotation?
Quotation is a direct reference to some other piece of text. For example, it can be the words of a famous person or a piece of a written text.

In fact, you've already seen a quotation in the [What Are Images?](#what-are-images) section!

### How to Quote?
To quote, use the greater-than symbol, ">", in front of the text you want to quote.
> Don't believe everything you read on the internet just because there's a picture with a quote next to it,
>*Confucius*

It looks like this:

```
> Don't believe everything you read on the internet just because there's a picture with a quote next to it,<p>
>*Confucius*
```

## Summary
Congratulations! You can now quote in no time!

# Quoting Code
Here you'll learn how to show code.

## What is Code?
Code are instructions for your computer to do things with, like create [Line Breakes](#line-break), [Headers](#headers), [Bold](#bold), [Italics](#italics), [Links](#links) or [Images](#images).

### How to Quote Code
Normally, Markdown code is executed when it's written as-is. If you want to show a piece of code – e.g. Markdown code or code in any programming language – and not execute it, you have to quote it appropriately.

In fact, pieces of code have been already quoted in this text!
<!-- Example of equation or inline code -->
#### Inline Code
If you want to quote just a short piece of code, you can use inline code.

To create inline code, place back tick symbol, "`", before the piece of code and end it again with this symbol.

This is an example of `**an inline Markdown code with _formatting_**` that won't be executed.

It looks like this:

<code>This is an example of \`\**an inline Markdown code with \_formatting_**` that won't be executed.</code>
<!-- Example of a block of code -->

#### Code Blocks
If you want to quote a large piece of code with several lines, you can use code blocks.

To create code block, place three back tick symbols, "`", before the piece of code and end it again with three symbols.

```
# This is a sample header that won't be executed

And this is a **sample** *text* formatting<p> that also [is not executed in Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
```
It looks like this:

<code>```
\# This is a sample header that won't be executed

And this is a \*\*sample\*\* \*text\* formatting\<p> that also \[is not executed in Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
\```
</code>

<!-- Example of code highlighting -->
#### Code Highlighting
If you want to show a piece of code in a given language and with higlighting given pieces, use [Code Block](#code-blocks).

Then, inside the code block, type which kind of language is to be processed, like in the example below.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
It looks like this:

<code>
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
</code>

#### Turning off the Code
You may be wondering by now how the code – even the [Inline Code](#inline-code) and [Code Blocks](#code-blocks) – have been shown here without executing it.

To turn off the execution of the code, place backslash, "\\", before the piece of the code you want to turn off.

\# This is a sample header that won't be executed

It looks like this:

<code>\# This is a sample header that won't be executed</code>

## Summary
Congratulations! You can now quote the code in no time!

<!-- Example of bullet list -->

# Bullet List
Here you'll learn how to add a bullet list.

## What Is Bullet List?
A bullet list is an arrangement of items, one under the other, that is placed in no particular order. Subsequent items are introduced by a symbol, usually a large dot that's called "bullet".

### How to Add a Bullet List
To add a bullet list to your text, just use the minus symbol, "-", in front of your item.

This is a sample list:
- Milk
- Honey
- Macaroni

It looks like this:
```
- Milk
- Honey
- Macaroni
```
When you press the ENTER key while creating a bullet list, the Visual Studio Code will create automatically another bullet point.

### How to Add Indentation to A Bullet List
To add indentation to a bullet list in your text, just press TAB key in front of the minus symbol, "-", in your bullet list.

This is a sample list:
- Milk
  - Protein
    - Muscle Gain 
- Honey
  - Sugar
    - Many Calories
      - High Energy
        - Working Longer
- Macaroni
  - Carbohydrates

It looks like this:
```
- Milk
  - Protein
    - Muscle Gain 
- Honey
  - Sugar
    - Many Calories
      - High Energy
        - Working Longer
- Macaroni
  - Carbohydrates
```
When you press the ENTER key while creating a bullet list, the Visual Studio Code will create automatically another bullet point at a given indentation.

To go up in your indentation level, just press BACKSPACE key.

## Summary
Congratulations! You can now create a bullet list in no time!

<!-- Example of numbered list -->
# Numbered List
Here you'll learn how to add a numbered list.

## What Is Numbered List?
A number list is an arrangement of items, one under the other, that is placed in a particular order. Subsequent items are introduced by a number.

### How to Add a Numbered List
To add a numbered list to your text, just type the number you want to start your list with, for instance "2", in front of your item.

Remember to place a dot right after the number!

This is a sample numbered list:

2. Work Hard
3. Rest Harder
4. Sleep Hardest

It looks like this:
```
2. Work Hard
3. Rest Harder
4. Sleep Hardest
```
When you press the ENTER key while creating a numbered list, the Visual Studio Code will create automatically subsequent numbered item.

### How to Add Indentation to A Numbered List
To add indentation to a numbered list in your text, just press TAB key in front of the number, e.g. "2", in your numbered list.

This is a sample list:

2. Work Hard
   1. But not too hard
3. Rest Harder
   1. But not too hard
      1. Lest you become lazy
   2. But stay away from screens
      1. Unless it's a cinema
   3. Going out is a good idea
      1. Unless it's smog outside
         1. If you don't have a smog mask
4. Sleep Hardest
   1. But wake up some time

It looks like this:
```
2. Work Hard
   1. But not too hard
3. Rest Harder
   1. But not too hard
      1. Lest you become lazy
   2. But stay away from screens
      1. Unless it's a cinema
   3. Going out is a good idea
      1. Unless it's smog outside
         1. If you don't have a smog mask
4. Sleep Hardest
   1. But wake up some time
```
When you press the ENTER key while creating a numbered list, the Visual Studio Code will create automatically another numbered item at a given indentation.

To go up in your indentation level, just press BACKSPACE key.

## Summary
Congratulations! You can now create a numbered list in no time!

<!-- Example of table -->
# Tables
Here you'll learn how to create tables.

## What Is a Table?
A table is a way of representing text in rows and columns. Tables are very useful to create lists with variables.

### How to Create a Table
To create a table, you have to create columns first.

To create a column in your table, use the vertical bar symbol, "|", and then type the content of the first column.

To add another column, repeat the first step.

At the last column, place again the vertical bar symbol.

Then, press the ENTER key right after the last vertical bar symbol. Next, use the minus symbol, "-", three times under the first cell of the first column and close the cell with the vertical bar symbol. Repeat this for all the columns.

To create a row in your table, press the ENTER key and start your row for your second column with the vertical bar symbol. Type what you want inside the cell and close it with the vertical bar symbol.

When you want to go to the cell in the same row but in another column, just begin typing the content.

Always remember to close the cell and the whole row with a vertical bar symbol.

| No. | Name   | Surname      | Age |
| --- | ------ | ------------ | --- |
| 1.  | Andrew | Appleby      | 20  |
| 2.  | Barbra | Battlecester | 30  |
| 3.  | Celine | Countburg    | 22  |
| 4.  | Derek  | Dugdon       | 25  |

It looks like this:
```
| No. | Name   | Surname      | Age |
| --- | ------ | ------------ | --- |
| 1.  | Andrew | Appleby      | 20  |
| 2.  | Barbra | Battlecester | 30  |
| 3.  | Celine | Countburg    | 22  |
| 4.  | Derek  | Dugdon       | 25  |
```
When you're finished with your table, just press the ENTER key two times, so you can begin a new paragraph of text.

### How to Create Alignment in a Table
To align your text to left, centre or right in a table, you can use colon ":". Place colon to the left, on both sides or to the right of the minus symbol between the bar symbol.

| No.  |  Name  |   Surname    |  Age |
| :--- | :----: | :----------: | ---: |
| 1.   | Andrew |   Appleby    |   20 |
| 2.   | Barbra | Battlecester |   30 |
| 3.   | Celine |  Countburg   |   22 |
| 4.   | Derek  |    Dugdon    |   25 |

It looks like this:
```
| No.  |  Name  |   Surname    |  Age |
| :--- | :----: | :----------: | ---: |
| 1.   | Andrew |   Appleby    |   20 |
| 2.   | Barbra | Battlecester |   30 |
| 3.   | Celine |  Countburg   |   22 |
| 4.   | Derek  |    Dugdon    |   25 |
```
When you're finished with your table, just press the ENTER key two times, so you can begin a new paragraph of text.

As you can see, this table includes paragraphs, text in bold, in italic and links to websites, images and even inline quote.

Note: creating a bullet or numbered list inside a table requires HTML tags, so it won't be covered here.
